# Face Recognition using OpenCV and Face Recognition Library

This project demonstrates face detection and recognition using OpenCV and the Face Recognition library. It detects faces in an image using the Haar Cascade classifier provided by OpenCV and recognizes known faces by comparing them with pre-registered faces using the Face Recognition library.

## Usage

To use this face recognition model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sv-medany/face-recognition.git`
2. Replace the images `me.jpeg` and `me2.jpeg` with your own images.
3. Run the provided Python script.
